Install
-------
In order to build everything with babel as browserify, clone this repo, and run..

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will produce a script with everything necessary called `bundle.js`. 
If you fire up a server from the root directory, then page in example should load it up.

In order to continuously rebundle, run..

```
npm run watch
```
